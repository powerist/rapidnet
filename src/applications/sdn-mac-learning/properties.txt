1. (@ Switch): Forall: have routing entry for MAC address A -> 
	(@Switch) have received a frame sourced from A 
(Assumptions: no spoofing, no changing it to a frame that has source MAC address A)

forall Switch, Mac_A, OutPort, flowEntry(Switch, MAC_A, OutPort) ->
	exists Nei, DstMac, packet(Switch, Nei, Mac_A, DstMac) 


2. Forall: (@End-host) Have received a frame B that is not destined to end-host A 
        -> (@Switch) Switch does not have a routing entry for B's dest address

forall Switch, Nei, Mac, Outport, 
	packet(Switch, Nei, Mac, Mac_B) AND Mac!=Mac_A AND Mac!=Mac_B ->
	(flowEntry(Switch, Mac, Outport) AND Mac!=Mac_B)

3. (@Switch) Not exist a routing entry to MAC address A -> (@Switch) never have received/forwarded a packet sourced from A

forall Switch, OutPort, Nei, DstMac, Mac,
	flowEntry(Switch,Mac,Outport) AND Mac != Mac_A **Not exist a routing entry to MAC address A**
	->
	packet(Switch,Nei,Mac,DstMac)  **never received packet from A**
	AND Mac != Mac_A
	AND (packet(Nei,Switch,Mac,DstMac)  **never forwaredd packet sourced from from A**
