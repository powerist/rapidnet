Learning Bridge

1. 
forall Switch, Mac_A, OutPort, Priority, flowEntry(Switch, MAC_A, OutPort, Priority) ->
	exists Nei, DstMac, packet(Switch, Nei, Mac_A, DstMac) 

Result: True
Time: 60ms

2. 
forall EndHost, Switch, SrcMac, DstMac, Outport, Mac, 
	packet(EndHost, Switch, SrcMac, DstMac), 
	flowEntry(Switch, Mac, Outport), DstMac != EndHost -> Mac != DstMac

Base constraints:
missEntry(v1, v2):
v1 != v2

inPort(v3,v4,v5):
v3 != v4
v4 != v5
v3 != v5

outPort(v6,v7,v8):
v6 != v7
v7 != v8
v6 != v8

Result: 
Time: 20ms

3. (@Switch) Not exist a routing entry to MAC address A -> (@Switch) never have received/forwarded a packet sourced from A
QUESTION: IS THE SWITCH THE SAME IN THE ANTECEDENT AND CONSEQUENT? 

forall Switch, Mac_A, OutPort, Nei, DstMac, Mac,
	(Mac!=Mac_A) -> 
		(flowEntry(Switch,Mac,Outport) != flowEntry(@Switch,Mac_A,OutPort)) 
		->
		(packet(Switch,Nei,Mac,DstMac) != packet(Switch,Nei,Mac_A,DstMac)) **received packet from A** 
		AND (packet(Nei,Switch,Mac_A,DstMac) != packet(Nei,Switch,Mac_A,DstMac)) **forward packet sourced from from A**

This is a liveness property
